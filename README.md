### I'm always looking for new challenges... ðŸ”­

Each day is a constant learning process, within all our working time it is possible to innovate, create and develop solutions that
are actually useful to other people, and even sometimes inspire them to achieve their dreams and goals with technology. I get a lot
happy and grateful to be part of this incredible world full of challenges and learning!

The development of software, web applications and even games are the forms of development that I like to do the most. what sums up
even more my profile is happiness and a lot of gratitude for being able to share and contribute a little bit of my experiences!
